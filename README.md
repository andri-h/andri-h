## 🌍 My recomondations to live a more sustainable and environment friendly life
A short overview of what I use, to make my life more sustainable. I know, that I don't live a sustainable life, but I try to improve myself repeatedly. 

In general:
- Reduce, reuse, recycle!
- If you have an item which you don't use anymore, support your local thrift shop or sell them.
- Share and rent items which you only use irregularly. There you can save money and resources!

### 💻 During my daily life as a software engineer
- use [ecosia.org](https://ecosia.org) as a search engine and plant trees all over the world with each search
- set [oceanhero.today](https://oceanhero.today) as a start page. With every visit you will help them removing plastic from the ocean (platic bank and waste free oceans)
- remove CO₂ from the air with [climeworks](https://climeworks.com/invitation/gqamVGqK) (1kg for free, no strings attached)

### 💰 Financial
- Only buy things you really need and replace only things which are broken and unrepairable.
- [neon green](https://www.neon-free.ch/en/neon-green), a bank account where you get 5 years warranty extension for each electronic device and they plant a tree for each 100.- CHF spent. With the code 'C00KY3' you get 10.- CHF and a free mastercard.
- Sustainable investments with the help of ESG indices by [SIX](https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/the-swiss-stock-exchange/market-data/indices/esg-indices.html)

### 🧼 Cosmetics
- Swiss made, honest, natural and vegan cosmetics made by [No Bullsh!t](https://nobullshit.care?referral_code=98B3ppmubVnbLbWy)
- Organic, natural, vegan, cruelty free and plastic free personal care products from [Ben & Anna](https://benanna.ch)
- With [klaeny](https://klaeny.de/a/refer-a-friend/redeem/iw5vyq2mrueuymmxotgwzkloqykql6ieo97laqgp/5328) you can reduce your plastic consumption for cleaning utilities. 

### 🥘 Food
- [Planted](https://www.eatplanted.com) is in my view even better for certain dishes than meat. It is based on natural ingredients and yummy!
- Buy local, organic and seasonally!
- Go to your local market or if you don't find time to, I recommend [farmy](https://www.farmy.ch/invite/andri218?nzp).

### 👕 Faishon
- Don't buy from fast fashion labels
- Check for the [GOTS](https://global-standard.org) label (organic and fair)
- [Nikin](https://prz.io/kPAJ1RpiB) is a swiss fashion label who produces most of the products within europe and plants trees for each sold item.
- Other labels I like: [Colorful Standard](https://colorfulstandard.ch), [Armedangels](https://www.armedangels.com/), [KnowledgeCotton Apparel](https://knowledgecottonapparel.com) & [Veja Shoes](https://www.veja-store.com)
- [RRREVOLVE](https://rrrevolve.ch) is a swiss fashion shop (online and offline) with a lot of fair fashion & eco design.

### 🏡 At home
- Don't use synthetic pesticides
- Give insects a home, like [Wildbiene + Partner](https://wildbieneundpartner.ch)
- Create a insect friendly garden / balcony, here are some tips from [WWF CH](https://www.wwf.ch/de/stories/biodiversitaet-foerdern-auf-dem-balkon-und-im-garten)
- If you plan for a new bathroom, consider a shower with heat recovery like [Joulia SA](https://joulia.com) from Switzerland.
- You need a new roof, or the current one has to be fixed? Consider a solar system. There are beautiful roof-integrated systems like MATCH from [megasol](https://megasol.ch) and MegaSlate from [3S Solar Plus](https://3s-solarplus.ch).
