## My recomondations to live a more sustainable and environment friendly life
A short overview of what I use, to make my life more sustainable. I know, that I don't live a sustainable life, but I try to improve myself repeatedly. 
### 💻 During my daily life as a software engineer
- use [ecosia.org](https://ecosia.org) as a search engine and plant trees all over the world with each search
- set [oceanhero.today](https://oceanhero.today) as a start page. With every visit you will help them removing plastic from the ocean (platic bank and waste free oceans)

### 💰 Financial
- Only buy things you really need and replace only things which are broken and unrepairable.
- [neon green](https://www.neon-free.ch/en/neon-green), a bank account where you get 5 years warranty extension for each electronic device and they plant a tree for each 100.- CHF spent. With the code 'C00KY3' you get 10.- CHF and a free mastercard.
- Sustainable investments with the help of ESG indices by [SIX](https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/the-swiss-stock-exchange/market-data/indices/esg-indices.html)

### 🧼 Cosmetics
- Swiss made, honest, natural and vegan cosmetics made by [No Bullsh!t](https://nobullshit.care?referral_code=98B3ppmubVnbLbWy)
- With [klaeny](https://klaeny.de/a/refer-a-friend/redeem/iw5vyq2mrueuymmxotgwzkloqykql6ieo97laqgp/5328) you can reduce your plastic consumption for cleaning utilities. 

### 🥘 Food
- [Planted](https://www.eatplanted.com) is in my view even better for certain dishes than meat. It is based on natural ingredients and yummy!
- Buy local, organic and seasonally!

### 👕 Faishon
- Don't buy from fast fashion labels
- Check for the [GOTS](https://global-standard.org) label (organic and fair)

### 🏡 At home
- Don't use synthetic pesticides
- Give insects a home, like [Wildbiene + Partner](https://wildbieneundpartner.ch)
